package Week1;
public class Day1 {  // public class Java file - should be same as file name 
    public static void main(String args[]){

        //public - should be access to everyone
        //static - methods can be run without creating object of Day1 class otherwise first I have to create Object like this Day1 obj = new Day1() and then run in main method but static is a good thing which says buddy dont make object of  class i will run for you 
        //void - it means it doesn't return anything - just run the program
        // main - java code start run from this in terminal 

        System.out.println("Hello World ");
        System.out.println("Hello I am CodeVibes");
        System.out.println("Don't forget to Enjoy");

    }
